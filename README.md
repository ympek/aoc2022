# Advent of Code 2022

promise yourself to solve all the puzzles and eventually give up on like 6th... - 2022 edition

This time I don't make any assumptions about the programming language upfront.

## Launcher usage

Type:

```
./day.sh <DAY_INDEX>
```

to run the code from a given day. Example: `./day.sh 3` will run the code from `day3` folder. You need to have corresponding interpreter/compiler installed yo.
